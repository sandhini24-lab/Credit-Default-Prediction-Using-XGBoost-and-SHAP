# Credit-Default-Prediction-Using-XGBoost-and-SHAP

Project Overview

This project focuseson prdicting the likelihoudt of credit default andal. using a tree-based ensernble model (XGBoost). Eppthesias:ess model explaina-bility through SHAP (SHapley Additive ePlanations), helping transialec technical results into actionable.

Objectives

Build a binary classification model to predict credit default.

Analyzo global and local feature importance using SHAP,

Translate SHAP results into clear business insights.

Tech Stack

Python, Laandas, numpy, xgboost, shap, sc

Libraries: panidas, numpy, xgboost, shap, socickiti-learn, matplotilb, seaborn

Tasks Completed

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.

Trained and tuned an XGBoost model for default prediction.

Evaluated performance using AUC precision, recall, and F1-score

Used SHAP to compute and visualize global teature importance.

Performed local SHAP analysis on 3 individual applicants (high-risk, risk, low-risk).

Synthesized findings into a strategic commentary for credit policy adjustment

Deliverables

Clean, execuble Python code

Global SHAP summary plot

Three local SHAP force plob with textual explanations

Strategic commentary with data-driven policy suggestions

Description:
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of credit default using a machine learning model (XGBoost). SHAP is used to explain the model's predictions and identify key factors influencing credit risk. The goal is to support better decision-making in credit approvals and policy adjustments.
